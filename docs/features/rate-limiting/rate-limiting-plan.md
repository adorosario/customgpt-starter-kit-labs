## ðŸŽ¯ **Mission: Demo-Ready Rate Limiting by Friday 11AM EST**

**Current State:** Manuel has pushed initial implementation to `feat/rate-limiting` branch
**Goal:** Functional demo showcasing enterprise rate limiting capabilities
**Timeline:** Monday 1PM â†’ Friday 11AM (3.5 working days)
**Demo Audience:** Entire company at Demo Day

## ðŸ“… **4-Day Sprint Breakdown**

### **MONDAY (TODAY) - Foundation Validation**
**Objective:** Assess what Manuel built and define demo scope

**Immediate Actions (Next 4 hours):**
- **Code Review**: Analyze Manuel's `feat/rate-limiting` branch implementation
- **Demo Scope Definition**: What specific features MUST work for the demo?
- **Testing Priority**: Which tests are critical vs nice-to-have?
- **Demo Environment Setup**: Where will we run the demo? Local? Deployed?

**Demo Scope Priorities (MVP for Friday):**
1. **Core Rate Limiting**: Basic per-minute/hour limits working
2. **Identity Extraction**: At least JWT + IP fallback working
3. **HTTP Headers**: Proper X-RateLimit-* headers in responses
4. **Admin Dashboard**: Basic view of current rate limits (even if simple)
5. **Demo Script**: 5-minute demo showing rate limiting in action

**NOT Required for Demo:**
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Turnstile integration (if complex)
- Full analytics dashboard
- Production deployment

### **TUESDAY - Core Implementation Polish**
**Objective:** Ensure core rate limiting works reliably for demo

**Priority Tasks:**
- **Rate Limiting Engine**: Ensure sliding window algorithm works correctly
- **Redis Integration**: Stable Redis operations without errors
- **Identity Waterfall**: JWT â†’ Session â†’ IP extraction working
- **HTTP Integration**: Rate limit headers appear correctly
- **Basic Admin View**: Simple dashboard showing current limits

**Success Criteria:**
- Can demonstrate user hitting rate limits
- Rate limit headers show correctly in browser dev tools
- Admin dashboard shows live counters
- No crashes or major errors

### **WEDNESDAY - Demo Environment & Polish**
**Objective:** Create reliable demo environment and smooth user experience

**Priority Tasks:**
- **Demo Environment**: Stable environment for Friday (local or simple deploy)
- **Demo Data**: Seed data and test scenarios for smooth demo
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of common errors
- **Performance**: Ensure demo runs smoothly without lag
- **Visual Polish**: Basic UI improvements for better demo appearance

**Demo Preparation:**
- **Demo Script**: Written step-by-step demo flow
- **Backup Plan**: What to do if something breaks during demo
- **Test Scenarios**: Pre-configured rate limits for different demo users

### **THURSDAY - Demo Rehearsal & Contingency**
**Objective:** Perfect the demo and prepare for any issues

**Priority Tasks:**
- **Full Demo Rehearsal**: Complete run-through of Friday presentation
- **Edge Case Testing**: Test what happens when things go wrong
- **Demo Improvements**: Polish based on rehearsal feedback
- **Documentation**: Basic README updates for demo context
- **Contingency Planning**: Backup demos if primary fails

**Demo Readiness Checklist:**
- [ ] 5-minute demo script tested and timed
- [ ] Demo environment stable and accessible
- [ ] All demo scenarios work reliably
- [ ] Fallback plan ready if tech issues arise
- [ ] Screenshots/videos as backup if live demo fails

### **FRIDAY - Demo Day**
**Objective:** Successful showcase at 11AM EST

**Morning Tasks (9-11AM):**
- **Final System Check**: Verify everything works one last time
- **Demo Environment Warm-up**: Ensure services are running and responsive
- **Backup Preparation**: Screenshots/recordings ready if needed
- **Demo Rehearsal**: Quick 5-minute run-through

## ðŸŽ¬ **Demo Flow (5-7 minutes)**

### **Demo Script Outline:**
1. **Context Setting** (30 seconds)
   - "We built enterprise-grade rate limiting for our CustomGPT starter kit"
   - "Prevents API abuse and enables usage-based billing"

2. **Identity & Rate Limiting Demo** (2 minutes)
   - Show user making API requests under the limit
   - Show rate limit headers in browser dev tools
   - Demonstrate user hitting rate limit and getting 429 error
   - Show different limits for different user types (JWT vs IP)

3. **Admin Dashboard** (2 minutes)
   - Show real-time rate limit monitoring
   - Display current usage vs limits
   - Demonstrate admin ability to view/modify limits

4. **Technical Highlights** (1 minute)
   - Redis-backed sliding window algorithm
   - <10ms performance overhead
   - Enterprise-ready identity waterfall

5. **Q&A Buffer** (1-2 minutes)
   - Handle questions about implementation
   - Discuss next steps and rollout plan

## ðŸ›  **Critical Technical Requirements for Demo**

### **Must Work:**
- [ ] Basic rate limiting (requests/minute and requests/hour)
- [ ] Identity extraction (JWT and IP minimum)
- [ ] HTTP 429 responses with proper headers
- [ ] Simple admin dashboard showing live data
- [ ] Stable demo environment

### **Should Work (if time allows):**
- [ ] Session-based identity extraction
- [ ] Multiple time windows (minute/hour/day)
- [ ] Rate limit configuration via admin UI
- [ ] Basic analytics/reporting

### **Nice to Have (skip if needed):**
- [ ] Turnstile integration
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Advanced admin features
- [ ] Production deployment

## ðŸš¨ **Risk Management**

### **High-Risk Items:**
1. **Redis Reliability**: What if Redis crashes during demo?
2. **Network Issues**: What if internet/API calls fail?
3. **Browser Compatibility**: What if demo doesn't work in presentation browser?
4. **Performance**: What if rate limiting is too slow for smooth demo?

### **Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Local Fallback**: Run demo locally if deployment issues
2. **Recorded Backup**: Record successful demo run as backup
3. **Multiple Browsers**: Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari
4. **Simple Scenarios**: Use basic rate limits that execute quickly
